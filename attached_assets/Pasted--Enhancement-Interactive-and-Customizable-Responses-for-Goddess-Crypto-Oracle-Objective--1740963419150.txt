### Enhancement: Interactive and Customizable Responses for Goddess Crypto Oracle

**Objective:**  
- Enhance the bot so that after displaying an initial prophecy, users can ask follow-up questions for additional insights.
- Allow users to specify a theme (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, governance) when invoking the prophecy command, so that the response aligns with their interests.

**Requirements:**

1. **Interactive Responses:**  
   - After the bot responds to the `!prophecy` command, enable it to listen for follow-up commands (e.g., `!insight` or `!detail`) that trigger additional context or deeper explanations related to the initial prophecy.  
   - Implement context tracking so that the follow-up relates to the previously generated prophecy.

2. **Customization Options:**  
   - Modify the `!prophecy` command to accept an optional parameter for the theme, for example:  
     ```
     !prophecy DeFi
     ```
   - Based on the specified theme (DeFi, NFTs, governance, etc.), adjust the generated prophecy to better reflect that topic.  
   - Provide a default prophecy if no theme is provided.

**Implementation Guidelines:**  
- **Discord Bot Code:**  
  - Update your command handler to parse additional parameters after `!prophecy`.  
  - Create a mapping of themes to specific prophecy content or modify the logic to dynamically incorporate theme keywords.

- **Context Handling:**  
  - After an initial prophecy is sent, store the prophecy context (e.g., in memory or a temporary object) so that when a follow-up command is issued, the bot can reference it to provide additional insights.

- **User Feedback:**  
  - Ensure that when a follow-up command is issued, the bot responds with a clear, context-aware message that adds value and depth to the initial prediction.

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A more engaging user experience where users not only receive a mystical prediction but can also interact with the bot for further insights.  
- Customizable prophecies that align with user-selected themes, enhancing relevance and personalization.

Please update the code accordingly to integrate these interactive and customizable features into Goddess Crypto Oracle.
